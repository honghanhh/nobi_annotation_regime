# ACTER in NOBI annotation regime - version 1.6

ACTER is a collection of manually annotated corpora for term extraction whose terms and/or named entities were labelled from the following domains: corruption, wind energy, equitation, and heart failure and are available in English, French, and Dutch. The original corpora (version 1-5) are available at [AylaRT/ACTER](https://github.com/AylaRT/ACTER). In this repo, we provide the annotated corpora in NOBI annotation format or so-called ACTER veriosn 1.6.
